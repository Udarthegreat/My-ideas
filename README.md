# This is my portfolio web site
## intro
I am currently rethinking and redesigning this so for now there is nothing to see here. 

### My ideas sorted by page

 - home page
 - others

## code formatting rules

This is simple enough at this point were it does not merit its own file.
 - format css classes, vars in js etc. with capital letters seperateing words like so `testTest`
 - indentation should be done through tabs not spaces unless truly necessary
 - have a empty line at the end of every file 
 - no external libraries like react, angular, and bootstrap, especially react
 - for colors use rgb(a) not hex or other methods
 - especially no code from FANG
 - ~

for more on versions of this page go to  [this](versions.md)  file, for my todo list go to  [this](todo.md)  file.

for licensing see [licence.md](licence.md), in short copy right me though I plan, in the future, to change that.
