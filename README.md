# earth-2.0
#ideas
a web site for earth 2.0.     
this is a temporary name (eath 2.0)
the test_# images are for testing the webpage only, they are not going to show in the fianal paroduct, they will be replaced by images of my ideas for this project. 
the drawings folder houses all of my idea drawings so cheack there if that is all you want
I am a bigginer in HTMl and CSS so they will be messy and not as effitient as posiible but I am always trying to make it as effitient as possible. 
I got the background image from PEXELS by serching "space"
I will update this as I get closer to finishing this project which I currently am not all that close to being.
