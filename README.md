# This is my portfolio web site

In this website you will find multiple different pages separated by idea or group.
the drawings folder houses all of my idea drawings so check there if that is all you want
I got the background image from [PEXELS](https://www.pexels.com/), though I am planning to use as meany of mine in the end (after finishing to format everything).
currently I am using fonts from google fonts but I am planning to, in the end, be having all the fonts held locally but again that is for after In get the design down; I tried to get it to work but only some of them work sometimes so I have more to learn about that.
I will update this as I get closer to finishing this project which I currently am not all that close to being.
