# This is my portfolio web site

    In this website you will find multiple different pages of my ideas/concepts separated by idea or group.
the drawings folder houses all of my idea drawings so check there if that is all you want
I got the background image from [PEXELS](https://www.pexels.com/), though I am planning to use as meany of mine in the end (after finishing formatting everything, and adding all the planned content).
currently I am using some fonts from google fonts but I am planning to, in the end, having all the fonts held locally but again that is for after I get the design down; I tried to get it to work but only some of them work sometimes so I have more to learn in that area that.
I will update this as I get closer to finishing this project which I currently am not all that close to being.

## code formatting

This is simple enough at this point were it does not merritt its own file.
 - classes with multiple words in them should be seperated by _ not - 
   - exception for the previous rule is when it is a file then use -
 - indents should be 4 spaces (so tabs should be bound to 4 spaces)
 - have a empty line at the end of every file 
 -
