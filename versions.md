# about

versioning for this repo does not use a standard versioning systems, so how does it work. As can be seen in the todo file every new version has a series of items I want to get done before I call it a new update, so every major number 1.0,2.0 etc. completes that set of goals. but I have found that I want to update the page faster then I can push out these features in full so I have decided to produce incremental updates that will have some of the intended updates in them these will be notated with a period and a the right number after it for example 1.1 or 2.4 etc. if there is a second decimal and number then that means that there have been no features completed just usually small changes like fixing glitches etc.
