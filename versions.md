# about

versioning for this repo does not use a standard versioning systems, so how does it work. As can be seen in the todo file every new version has a series of items I want to get done (kept track of in [todo.md](todo.md)) before I call it a new update, so every major number 1.0,2.0 etc. completes that set of goals. but I have found that I want to update the page faster then I can push out these features in full so I have decided to produce incremental updates that will have some of the intended updates in them these will be notated with a decimal value for example 1.1 or 2.4 etc. if there is a second decimal and number then that means that there have been no features completed just usually small changes like fixing glitches etc.
this file will contain all versions from the point this file was created so 2.1.

## versions

### 2.1

- convert the gallery from earth 2.0 from normal display block using position: absolute; to css grid
- worked on standardizing the css
  - title area
  - description area
  - parallax areas
  - image gallery
  - image slide show
- fix description tag for the first slide show's positioning
- fix the issue with earth 2.0 were the css grid will not become taller then a certain amount
- take all pre's and turn them to p's because of the issues properly formatting pre's especially when it comes to responsiveness.
- put a images into a images folder and separate images into sub folders per category.
- make the descriptions work for the 705 size

as a side note on 2/18/2022 I pushed what I had in testing to master so would be considered  2.2 but because I worked only minimally on this throughout 2021 I forgot most of what i had done so I have decided to not place a section since it would be empty, though I am leaving this note here for posterity. if you want more then go to the git commit history since I tend to document what I do decently well in those. 
### 3

- gutted most of the site and left website under construction in what was left over. 

### 4

full page redesign, it now generated from markdown and has been redesigned since as I was working on what would have been 2.2 I came to realization that I was fundamentally not happy with how it looked so in february of 2022 I gutted it put out 3.0 then put on the index website is under construction and left it for when I had time. Now that I had time I redesigned it and am much happier with the outcome. (currently this is here since it is the best place I could find to show what my goals are for this project since it will be on hiatus for a while after 3 drops).
