# about

Versioning for this repo does not use a standard versioning systems, so how does it work. As can be seen in the todo file every new version has a series of tasks I want to complete (kept track of in [todo.md](todo.md)) before I increment to the next major version number 1.0,2.0 etc.. But I have found that I want to update the live page faster then I can push out these major versions in full so I have decided to produce incremental updates that will have some of the intended updates in them these will be notated with a decimal value for example 1.1 or 2.4 etc. if there is a second decimal and number then that means that there have been no features completed just usually small changes like fixing major glitches etc. or parts of features. 
This file will contain all versions from the point this file was created so 2.1 since I did not properly track this until latter in the history of this repo and I do not feel like going through the full full commit history of the repo to properly compile this right now.

## versions

### 2.1

- convert the gallery in the earth 2.0 page from normal display block using `position: absolute` to css grid
- worked on standardizing the css
  - title area
  - description area
  - parallax areas
  - image gallery
  - image slide show
- fix description tag for the first slide show's positioning
- fix the issue with earth 2.0 were the css grid will not become taller then a certain amount
- take all pre's and turn them to p's because of the issues properly formatting pre's especially when it comes to responsiveness.
- put a images into a images folder and separate images into sub folders per category/use.
- make the descriptions work for the 705 size

### 2.2 

as a side note on 2/18/2022 I pushed what I had in testing to master but because I worked only minimally on this throughout 2021 I forgot most of what I had done during that time so I will leave this paragraph to explain. If you want more then go to the git commit history since I tend to document what I do decently well in my commit messages I just don't currently feel like doing that my self. 

### 3.0

Gutted most of the site and left website under construction in what was left over. The only pages left are index, others and 404, index with nothing other than a message that I am gutting the site and that it is a work in progress, I left a image grid in others because that will likely be there when I complete the redesign and because I consider that important and the 404 page is important, though it will likely get at least a touch up when I redesign the site. I also kept the testing html page because it may come in useful latter though for now its completely empty

### 4.0

(As a note here, I am putting this here since this repo is public as a reference, I am not yet certain when this will be complete. I am putting this here to give potential viewers of this repo an idea as to what is happening and why (what my thought process is)). At some point in January or February of 2022 while I was writing what would become version 2.2 of the website I became unhappy with its design etc. so I decided to almost completely gut it and start over. version 4.0 will be the realization fo this idea, were the website will be generated from Markdown with an almost complete redesign of the website. It did take me a while to redesign the finish the gutting due to various things that have happened in my life since (with the gutting being completed and merged into master on 06/11/2023). Again development on this will be on hiatus for a while until I get back to it.
