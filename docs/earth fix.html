                These are my ideas for making a vessel that could theoretically take humanity from
                earth to a planet that could hold us if and when it becomes the case that it may be necessary.
                The vessel its self is a sphere with multiple hemispherical layers within it , each spinning at
                relativistic speeds, as to keep an illusion of 1g of gravity as to curve bone mass loss and
                other negative effects of micro g,there is a tube through the center in which the control
                center and all governmentally run labs should be hosted, also were in most food should be
                produced by government and private entities, on the layers private citizens would be able
                to own property for homes and private businesses. Also within these rings there would be
                borders so nations can continue to be a thing so the hassle that would come with taking nations
                apart can be avoided if there is such a thing at the time of completion, the vessel its self
                would have 2 propulsion systems a Alcubierre warp drive or something similar capable of similar
                speeds (90 - 95% of c) and a set of rocket engines to navigate through (relatively) small spaces
                (small compared to the size earth 2.0 would have to be for example navigating between to planets
                etc.) I sketch down my ideas and transfer them to electronic forms I have sorted them by category
                and put them below, again these are ideas and are not ment to thought of anything more, all
                I am is a amateur putting his ideas out there for all to see because I would like to hope that they
                may inspire others and come in some use at some point.

                complete).</p>
