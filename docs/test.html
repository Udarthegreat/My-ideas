                <p class="about">for as long as I've known my self I have wondered how things worked and tried to
                    make things my self or at least design ideas because I never had the resources
                    to make anything to complex. for me learning is the ultimate goal so
                    what is on this site may vary incredibly because on here I put my ideas etc.
                    that is what a portfolio is for after all. I love physics especially the more
                    theoretical ends like general relativity and above all want homo sapiens to not
                    go extinct. That is why I even started on earth 2.0 to think up a way that hypotheticals
                    we could go on even when, in the distant future the sun runs out of fuel and
                    we have to leave our home planet. </p>
